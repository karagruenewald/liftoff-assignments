## Submission Instructions

### Overview <br>
My project will be a bike trail/ bike destination application that will allow users to search for bicycle trails and bike friendly destinations that meet certain search criteria.  Search results will return links to details about specific trails and clicking on that link will return trail info along with bike friendly destinations accessible right off of that trail.  The application will also allow a user to create destinations off the trails that they have deemed bike friendly.

This project came from an interest of exploring my local restaurants, parks, and shops via bike trails. I was curious to see what places I could access directly from the trails I was riding, but without spending lots of time researching and mapping on my own, it was hard to tell for example, which restaurants I could access right off the trail that had an outdoor patio.  This app will be beneficial to those who like exploring local spots via their local bike trails.
### Features <br>
- Search capability: General users will be able to search for bike trails & destinations using several search parameters
- View Trail information: General users can view details about trails returned in their search
- View Destination information: General users can view details about destinations linked to specific trails
- User sign-up: Users will be able to create an account 
- Create Destinations: Logged in users will be able to add bike destinations to a specific bike trail

### Technologies<br>
- C#
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Razor Pages
- MySQL
- Bootstrap
### What I'll Have to Learn<br>
I would like to incorporate the use of Google Maps into my application to allow users to search for trails within a certain distance of a zipcode so I will need to learn how to do that(this will likely be something I do down the road).  I will also need to learn how to create user logins to allow users to submit their own destinations they deem bike friendly.
